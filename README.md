# odin-recipes

This is the repository for The Odin Project's "Recipies" project. This segment of the Foundations course is meant to teach the basics of web development, including HTML and CSS.

It told me to write a README, so I did. I actually already know all this stuff, but I thought it'd be cool to do it anyway.

Here's a link to the page on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).
